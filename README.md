# Tauri Plugin Shellx

This is a modified version of the official Tauri plugin [tauri-plugin-shell](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-shell).

The purpose is to remove restrictions on shell commands (every command has to be pre-defined in capability).

This plugin allows you to execute any shell commands freely without any restrictions.
